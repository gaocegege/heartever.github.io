I am a research assistant professor at [Institute of Information Engineering (IIE)](http://www.iie.ac.cn/). I have been visiting [Prof. XiaoFeng Wang](https://www.informatics.indiana.edu/xw7/)'s group in [Indiana University Bloomington](https://www.indiana.edu/) since April 2016. My research interests now focus on protecting user privacy data with the help of hardware features, such as [Intel SGX](https://software.intel.com/en-us/sgx). I also work closely with Prof. Wang and [Prof. Haixu Tang](https://www.informatics.indiana.edu/hatang/) in organizing the [Genomic data privacy and security protection competition](http://www.humangenomeprivacy.org/2017/). Please find my cv [here](https://heartever.github.io/files/cv.pdf).
