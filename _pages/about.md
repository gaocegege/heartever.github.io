I am now a research assistant professor at [Institute of Information Engineering](http://www.iie.ac.cn/). Now I am visiting Prof. XiaoFeng Wang's group in Indiana University Bloomington. My research interest now focuses on protecting user privacy data with the help of hardware features, such as Intel SGX. 

Education
======
•	Ph.D. in Information Security, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences                                 Jan 2015
Dissertation Title: Optimization of time memory tradeoff algorithms
Abstract: Time memory tradeoff, a generic method to invert one-way functions, is widely used in password cracking applications. The dissertation shows how to obtain optimized parameters based on theoretical analysis of tradeoff coefficient with different parameter sets. A prototype system to verify the theoretical results is also built.
•	B.E. in Computer Science and Technology, Ocean University of China                                         July 2009
Rank: 1st of 33. Thesis: A design of travelling path recommendation system in railway networks
Abstract: Design and implementation of a user-friendly path recommendation system. It integrated a weighted Dijkstra algorithm with a database based representation of railway timetables from all over the country. It is the primary part of the work under the National Undergraduates Innovative Experimentation Project.
