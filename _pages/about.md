I am now a research assistant professor at [Institute of Information Engineering](http://www.iie.ac.cn/). Now I am visiting Prof. XiaoFeng Wang's group in Indiana University Bloomington. My research interest now focus on protecting user privacy data with help of hardware features, such as Intel SGX.
