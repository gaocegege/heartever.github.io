I am now a research assistant professor at [Institute of Information Engineering](http://www.iie.ac.cn/). I have been visiting [Prof. XiaoFeng Wang](https://www.informatics.indiana.edu/xw7/)'s group in [Indiana University Bloomington](https://www.indiana.edu/) since April 2016. My research interest now focuses on protecting user privacy data with the help of hardware features, such as [Intel SGX](https://software.intel.com/en-us/sgx).
